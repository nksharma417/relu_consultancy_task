# relu_consultancy_task

So, this is describing about the task you have to do in your document. So, according to the task I was given with a csv file containing asin and country code and a url in which I have to use those codes. After that collect the data from those urls and make a well-organiesd json. 

Now, telling my approach how I completed this task. Firstly, I imported the csv file and created a list containing all the urls with proper format so that we can direct visit those urls. 
I used Selenium to collect data from all those urls. According the requirements, I created a sample of 100 random urls and collected the data which is needed. I did not get any captcha in between this if I had got this I had solved that also. 
After collecting all the data which is available I created a json file and dumped it at my local disk. I could have done it into any mysql or any other database. 

And for the bonus task, I have created a different file which is showing how can we bypass the captcha on this website.
